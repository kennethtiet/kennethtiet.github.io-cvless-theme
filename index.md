# About

Hey there! Welcome to the 'site. My name's Kenneth. I recently graduated from USC with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Currently, I conduct [research](https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/2/5230/files/2023/09/64_SCR_23_Kenneth_Tiet.pdf) at the [USC Haptics Robotics and Virtual Interaction Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/culbertson/) and teach robotics at the [Institute of Arts, Music, & Science](http://www.iams-usa.org/). 

Previously, I was a software intern building industry software tools at [RoviSys](https://www.rovisys.com).

# Currently
I'm [reading](read) Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. I'm also learning new skills by following [this](https://roadmap.sh/backend) roadmap.

<!-- This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](cv) to see the full CV, and [here](assets/files/cv.pdf) to download a print version. The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).

Below is a list of blog posts included for illustrative purposes. Make sure to delete or modify them before deploying your website. -->
