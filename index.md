# About

Hey there! Welcome to the site. I spend my time researching at [USC Haptics Robotics and Virtual Interaction Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/culbertson/) and teaching robotics at the [Institute of Arts, Music, & Science](http://www.iams-usa.org/). Recent USC graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science. I enjoy working out, cooking, swimming, reading, amongst other things.

More stuff coming. Meanwhile, you can look at my resume [here](assets/files/KennethTietResume.pdf).

<!-- This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](cv) to see the full CV, and [here](assets/files/cv.pdf) to download a print version. The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).
